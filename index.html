      <h3>Hobbies</h3>
        <p>I've pretty much only had 2 main hobbies, soccer and video games. I started playing
          soccer when I was 7 years old. My favorite time playing was during high school, I loved
          going to practice everyday after school and playing with my friends. When I'm not pkaying
          soccer, I'm playing video games. I've collected pretty much all game systems since I was a
          kid so I have a lot of games.
